## Abstract
Our team investigated election data related to the state of Texas. The state is the country’s second largest electoral prize, with its 38 electoral votes second to only California’s 55 electoral votes. It is trailed by New York and Florida which each have 29 electoral votes.

Typically, there is limited pre-election national media interest in the Texas results, and for good reason. Texas is a consistently Republican state. In fact, the last time Texas voted statewide for a Democrat in the Presidential election was in 1976. Texas does not typically matter in the race to 270 electoral votes, and in turn, the U.S. Presidency.

However, in the 2020 election cycle, some national political media outlets rated the state as a “toss up.” Ultimately Texas remained Republican. In our report, we use historical and early vote data to provide a better picture of why the outlets made this last-minute rating change.

In part, this was due to unprecedented early voter turnout nationally and *particularly* in Texas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed the historical early vote data in every year since 1996 to give context to the 2020 early vote. To show how Texas has voted historically, we plotted the difference between Republicans and Democrats in every Presidential election since 1976. 

To give a more recent context about elections in Texas, we analyzed the 2018 midterm elections, the 2018 demographic data which we projected to 2020, and have built an R-Shiny application that shows the early vote by day in each Texas county in 2020. We also investigate whether there was a difference between the counties with Whole Foods Markets and those without, and explain the backstory of the why that's worth analyzing.
